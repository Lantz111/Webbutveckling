      <h2>Buissnesses</h2>
      <h3>Agne has alot money flowing in from different directions. Everthing from his realestate buissness to several illegal sources.<h3>
      <h3>His realestate firm, his primary job and the cover of his empire, is located i Kinna, a small village in the southern part of Sweden. He has a total of 246 different estates signed to his company. The estates are mostly apartment building, not your normal block of apartments, we are talking like 40 storie skyscrapers.</h3>
      <h3>But not that many people know that his estatebuissness only is a cover for his real moneymilking buissnesses. The dark side of his buissness empire. The drugdealin, the smuggling, the illegal imports. Agne's buissnesses supplies half of the cocaine usage and a third of the marijuana demand in the world.</h3>
      <h3>Agne owns a quarter of the land of Ecuador and fifth of Columbia where he runs all of his drugproduction. We havn'nt really gotten any info on how many druglabs he owns but if you look at the amount he exports we have estimated it to about 400 to 500 labs all over his property.</h3>
      <h3>The export goes down through his transport company called "AgnesBåtar". The company has got a list of 35 registerd cargoships. Most of the export goes from the companys private harbour where no one are allowed without going through the intense security check. The boats has three different destinations, Miami, Barcelona and HongKong, from there the products are later transported by land with either his traincomany ,"AgnesTåg", or his lorrycompany "AgnesLastbilar".</h3>
      <h3>All of these transports are heavily armed with alot of firearms cosidering how much value the product has its not that wierd, its always better to be on the safe side.</h3>
